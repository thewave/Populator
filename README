Populator
---------
This project loads a repository with objects from your business classes. It is a complete rework from the idea of HibernateMock (thanks to Celio Vasconcelos).

Populator was designed to set all fields from the business class, except the ones which has information.

Usage
-----
1) Define a Persistence Unit (persistence.xml)
	see Entities Definition

2) Create a Populator
	Populator p = PopulatorFactory.createPopulator();

3) (optional) Define patterns
	p.addPattern(String.class, "This is a pattern to all String classes");

4) Populate the database
	p.populate(BasicEntity.class);

5) Cleaning the database
	p.clear();

Entities Definition
-------------------
Populator uses the RepositoryJPA. So, it requires your business classes to fulfill some requirements.

1) It must have an @Entity.
2) It must implements Serializable.
3) It must have a Long id field, annotated with @Id.
4) It must have an Integer version field, annotated with @Version.
5) It must have a Boolean active field (for logical removal).
6) It must have a public constructor without arguments (or none, if there aren't any other constructors).
7) It must have an Equals and a HashCode methods.

There is an example:

@Entity
public class BasicEntity implements Serializable {
	
	@Id
	private Long id;
	
	@Version
	private Integer version;
	
	private Boolean active;
	
	public Entidade(){
	}

	@Override
	public boolean equals(Object obj) {
		return super.equals(obj);
	}

	@Override
	public int hashCode() {
		return super.hashCode();
	}
	
}
